/// @notice A stage in a revnet's lifecycle. Each stage defines the token issuance rate, how quickly it decays, what
/// percentage goes to splits, and the cash-out tax rate. Stages are processed in order — each one activates at or
/// after
/// its `startsAtOrAfter` timestamp.
/// @custom:member startsAtOrAfter The earliest timestamp this stage can begin. Must be strictly increasing across
/// stages. @custom:member autoIssuances Tokens to mint without payment during this stage (per-chain, per-beneficiary).
/// @custom:member splitPercent The percentage of newly issued tokens routed to splits, out of 10,000.
/// @custom:member splits The split recipients for this stage's production allocation.
/// @custom:member initialIssuance Tokens per unit of base currency at stage start (18-decimal fixed point).
/// @custom:member issuanceCutFrequency Seconds between each issuance reduction. Should be >= 24 hours.
/// @custom:member issuanceCutPercent How much issuance decreases each period, out of 1,000,000,000. 0 = no decay.
/// @custom:member cashOutTaxRate The tax on cash outs, out of 10,000. 0 = no tax (full reclaim). Higher = more tax
/// retained by the treasury.
/// @custom:member extraMetadata Additional metadata bits passed to hooks for stage-specific behavior.
